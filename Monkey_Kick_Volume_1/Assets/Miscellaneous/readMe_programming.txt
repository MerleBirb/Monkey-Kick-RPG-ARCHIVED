~Example C# Script Naming Convetion~

/* ---Description---:
 * Add a description at the top before the class is declared like this,
 * and add a name and date the script was started for fun. If any code
 * was referenced from a tutorial, here is a good place to site it.

if any variable or functions need extra explaining inside or out, 
// normal comments
work just fine.

normal variables: camelCase
protected variables: _camelCase
auto property variables: UppercaseCamel
constants: UPPERCASE_SNAKE
normal functions: UppercaseCamel
getter / setters: UppercaseCamel
enums: UPPERCASE_SNAKE = number * 100, so if new ones are made in between, you have
	100 places to make them

if your coding style differs from mine, that's ok as long as it works together with mine.
this is just a little guide for help :>
