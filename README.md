# Monkey-Kick-RPG
A passion project I have been working on for a long time. Monkey Kick is a turn based 3D adventure role playing game with timed action inputs. The characters are sprites, and the world is 3D. Still working on the story...

Currently working on the Demo during a Summer Studio class.
